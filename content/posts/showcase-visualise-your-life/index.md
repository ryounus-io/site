description: This is the first project I built that I will use to kickoff the new 'Showcase' series with. I had several targets for this year and one of them was to build more user facing projects that I can use as part of my poftofolio. I will talk about what I built and how to use it yourself.

### What is the Showcase Series ðŸŽ™ðŸŽ¨

The Showcase series is something new that I'm trying on my blog, it will be my first go at starting a dedicated series that I will post under. This series aims to fulfill one of the targets that I set out for myself in 2021, I discussed in my [2020 review]() how I build a lot of cool neat stuff that  never really host them publicly so no one ever sees them in the wild. The code for these projects has always been public and open-source but never hosted anywhere. This year that will change, I will build awesome fun stuff whilst learning new technologies. I can use services like [Netlify]() and [Vercel]() to host my projects for free, so theres nothing to hold me back.

### Visualise your life ðŸŽ©âœ¨

This tool I built takes your date of birth, calculates your age in weeks and then visualise how much of your life you have lived so far. It can be a great way to visualise where you currently are in life and motivate you to achive greater heights. The idea was based off a video I saw online where someone had purchased a [poster](https://4kweeks.com/products/poster) with the exact same idea and they would colour in each week as it passed. It sounded awesome and would a nifty tool for people to play around with, so I built my own. The aim of this tool is supposed to be to motivate and push people to make the most of their life, it shouldn't be seen as a negative thing.

This project was a great chance for me to hack around with new technologies, so I used [Svelete]() to create it. I have seen a lot of praise for Svelete as a new and upcoming underdog in the frontend space, so this was a great chance for me to get first hand experience with it. I also got the chance to use [Rollup]() as my bundler instead of [Webpack](), as well as using the [Canvas API]() to do more complex stuff than I had done in the past.

[Svelete]() is a new JS framework used to build powerful reactive user interfaces. It is well known for taking an alternative approach to the traditional virtual DOM used by other web fraeworks. Due to this difference it is often seen in benchmarks out-perform other frontend frameworks. In my expereince I was plesently surprised with the ease of use of this framework, it is very natural and easy to adapt to. I was up and going in no time. It has more of componenet style approach that was used by Vue in the past instead of the new functional approach. The documentation is great, I didn't really need to look at any other resources. I do feel like the community isn't as great but that would be a given for any new framework. It doesnt yet have the maturity and rich community that React and Vue enjoy. I'm sure it will in the future as more and more people try it out. When I first built this project I used the typescript starter template that they provide in the documentation, I quickly found it quite limiting and felt like it wasnt adding any benefit, it seemed more like a hiderance. This comes from someone who loves using typescript for backend projects. This may be an unpopular opinion but Typescript doesnt belong on the frontend.

The whole project is proudly hosted on Netlify and can be accessed [here](), it is open-source so the repository is available on my Github [here](). Any contributions are welcome.
