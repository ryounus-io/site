description: How I very quickly and efficiently added dark mode support to my site

> Disclaimer: Even though I consider myself a full-stack developer, I believe my backend skills are more dominant than my frontend ones. However I donâ€™t shy away from any frontend work and I actually embrace it for its own unique challenges. This post is based on my personal experience on styling my site and the approach I took, Iâ€™m sure there are other ways this couldâ€™ve been implemented and they maybe even be better solutions but this is my way which works for me.

**TL;DR** I implemented dark mode *support* on my site using Tailwind with a one line addition ðŸŒ—ðŸš€

The eager eyed amongst you may have had a look under the hood of my website and seen what tech itâ€™s built up on, you donâ€™t need to look far to see the utility first approach I have taken to my CSS. Before you guys run wild and critisce the approach, let me in this post run through the reason why i chose it and why I love it.

### Why Tailwind

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom solutions, it is relatively new and well-received in the dev community. To those who may not be familiar with what is meant by `utility first`, pretty much all the classes you will need already exists. For example, there are width and height utilities available which have an incremental approach allowing you to use classes in your mark-up that look like the below;

```html
<div class="d-block bg-white h-10 w-5 p-5"></div>
```

So, in the above code block, I have applied several utilities to the div element, all applied as several separated *utility classes*. In a more traditional setting, you would need define your own classes with all those properties, give those meaningful names and then use them. You may not see a big benefit in having all the utility classes pre-defined but what it allows you to do is rapidly build and prototype interfaces.

This utility first approach can lead to long and ugly class names in your mark up, but it allows you to develop really quick and efficiently without writing any custom CSS. I believe itâ€™s one of those concepts that you have to try out for yourself to appreciate.

In the Tailwind Docs, Adam Wathan, the creator of Tailwind, has specifically created a page on utility first and outlined all its benefits and criticisms, I would recommended doing some [further reading](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first)

My whole site uses this approach to styling and because of it I have had to use very little custom CSS. Pretty much all of it is predefined for me to use by Tailwind. Below is a snippet of my hero component on my site

```html
<h2 class="heading text-nord-1 text-xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl xl:text-6xl">
  Hello, I'm Rahman.
</h2>
<h3 class="heading text-nord-3 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl xl:text-3xl">
  Full-Stack Software Developer.
</h3>
```

As you can see I have quite a few classes in my mark up, it leads to a more expressive way of styling as you know exactly what each class does, giving them single responsbilities. 

As you can also see from the example is that all my browser breakpoints are also defined so when the conditions apply the browser will automatically use those classes instead. 

Itâ€™s actually quite powerful in what it brings to the table, no more messing with your naming scheme for classes, no need for large custom CSS files and no more slow development.

### What is Dark mode

Dark mode support simply adds a darker variant of the default interface, the colours chosen should be easier on the eye and aim to reduce strain, as the name may suggest usually the colours are of a darker palette.

Dark mode support for websites has slowly been rolling out accross the board, more and more apps are now implementing it. I think one of the first apps that I encountered in the wild with dark mode support was Twitter. Most social media platforms have now released dark mode support, I personally love dark mode as it reduces strain on my eyes at night.

On the web, most browsers now support dark mode via a simple [media query]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme). This now allows you to define queries to correctly pick the correct colour based on the end users system preferences. If you have a look at the browser adoption on [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/#feat=prefers-color-scheme) it is looking really good, most browsers have good support for it.

### My implementation

My inspiration for adding Dark mode on my website was based on a tweet I saw where someone had quite easily achieved it using Tailwind via a custom config entry. I tried to search for the tweet to include it here but could no longer find it now.

So the kicker to this whole implementation is a simple one line addition in the default Tailwind config.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      screens: {
        dark: { raw: "(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" }, // <- This line is the magic sauce âœ¨ðŸ’«
      },
    },
  },
}
```

That little addition is all thatâ€™s needed to basically have dark mode in Tailwind, crazy right ðŸ‘€...

Adding this line has allowed us to separate our utilities based on a `dark` breakpoint. So if that `dark` media query applies it will use those styles over the default existing ones.

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-grey"> 
```

Above is an example of how it would look when implemented, the default background is defined as white but if the media query is applicable it would use grey instead. As you can imagine this makes implementing dark mode quite a breeze as all I have to do is simply just add the correct class for dark mode.
