description: My journey through redundancy and finding a better job in the end

> *Disclaimer: I fully understand that I am a privileged individual who has a university degree and multiple years of experience backing me, I understand that others who have been made redundant may have struggled a lot more in getting another job, this post does not intend to make light of their struggles.*

**TL;DR** I was made redundant towards the back end of last year, I did fortunately get given a brief warning beforehand and made the most of it by applying for multiple jobs that I had interest in. I managed to land the job I really wanted and finally made the move towards the tech/stack I always wanted to be a part of.

#### Job before redundancy

I want to make it clear that I was happy and content in the job I had previously, I was a Senior Software Developer working at a commercial Energy Supplier. I was primarily working in Laravel and VueJs, these were our technologies of choice. I quite enjoyed working in Laravel as it has a really good developer experience, it makes PHP modern and a pleasure to work in.

The company I worked for was also great, we had a small team of developers based in Leeds, I got on with everyone and don't really have a bad word to say against any of them. Some background about the company I worked for to help you understand the way we operated, we were originally a small agency and had the energy supplier as one of our largest clients. Once the energy supplier got big enough, they wanted to buy us out and be their dedicated IT team. We decided to agree and after a transition period we became part of the energy supplier. We kept our agency style of working because it worked really well for us; we attended conferences together, went to regular meetups, got given Friday afternoons for research and development and were also able to pursue certification.

The company also gave me my first big promotion, I became a  Senior Developer there and really enjoyed being one. It was really good move for my career and gave me extra responsibilities to help push me further. I did however feel like I didn't have much room to grow, the limiting factor was not the company but the tech stack that we used. I personally really wanted to move into full stack JavaScript, using it for both our frontend and backend. I really enjoyed working on the frontend with VueJs as it gave me new challenges and re-ignited a passion which I think I had lost in working with Laravel for so long. JavaScript also had the magpie effect with me, it was really shiny and full of hype on Twitter and I was really hit with FOMO.

Usually the item in question is either glittery or catching the light causing the victim to become entranced by said item.* [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Magpie%20Effect)

#### Being made redundant

Sometime in October, we had our usual team stand-up and that’s where we were told the dreadful news. We were told that there a was a chance we could be made redundant if the company could not gather funds, we needed funds to keep afloat and were looking at investor options. I remember that month was quite intense and negative as we were living in fear of the impending news, I still remember not feeling creative or even motivated to work like I used to before. I used to feel deflated and was worried for my livelihood, I had a lot of financial plans that I wanted to aim for, and this would affect them. Whilst this was all going on, the smart move was to apply for as many jobs as we potentially could.

Fast-forward to around mid-October, we were given the bad news we were expecting but hoped would never receive, we were told we would be made redundant as we were no longer required, and the company would soon cease trading. It wasn’t really a huge shock to us as we were expecting it, being made redundant is still one of the worst feelings I have experienced in life. I was fortunate enough to have savings saved away which I could lean on in tough times if needed. Since we were made redundant mid-month we also didn't get our salary for the month, we were required to claim this back from the government and it could take 6-8 weeks for us to see our October wage.

#### Landing the new Job

One of the companies I had applied for was **DAZN**, they are a sports streaming company who use a really cool and modern tech stack which includes technologies like; TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, React, Mobx, AWS Lambda etc. I was really liking the sound of the company as they worked in a lot of technologies I wanted to learn or was learning in my personal time. Working for a big, well-recognised company like this would also look really good on my CV and help me land other big opportunities in the future, so applying to this company was a no-brainer for me.

I was already familiar with the tech recruiter who worked internally for DAZN, he helped me land my first job out of university in the past. We had good working relationship and I enjoyed working with him as a recruiter, which is not really something you can say a lot as a developer. I applied for the job myself and messaged the recruiter about it to help fast-track my application as I was on the brink of being made redundant at the time, he was really helpful, and I believe he did help hasten the whole process.

I was invited in for a formal chat over coffee to see if the company would be a good fit for me, I went there and really liked what I had heard about the company, it all sounded really positive and I was really hoping to work for this company one day. I then was sent a technical test to do, I decided to spend 3 or 4 solid evenings on it to really amaze the recruiter and the person who would judge it, I decided to do it JavaScript which I have worked on in the past, but wasn't the language I had the most experience in. I did this to prove my proficiency in JavaScript and my ability to adapt to change. In the tech test I also included a lot of nice to haves to make it even more impressive. Fortunately, they were really impressed with it and wanted to bring me in for an interview. I was really nervous for the interview and spent a lot of time prepping for it, it was the opportunity I really wanted, and I had spent so long on the tech test and prepping for the interview, so I didn’t want it to be in vain and a waste of time. The interview went quite well generally, there were a few things I wish I did better on, but I was feeling somewhat good about it. Fast forward to Monday, I received a phone call with the offer from the recruiter and was overwhelmed and glad that they accepted me. They wanted me to start as a Software Engineer on a good salary, quite a move up from what I was on before, I couldn’t be any happier.

#### Conclusion

If you're still here reading this, then I want to say thank you for sticking by, I hope it's been a good and insightful read. As you probably can imagine the end of 2019 was quite an emotional and mental rollercoaster for me. I hope I managed to capture some of those feelings in this post. I am still working at DAZN and am thoroughly enjoying it here; I'm picking up a lot of cool new tech and couldn't really ask for anything more. 

*To conclude, in a way for me this whole ordeal was a blessing in disguise as it led me to a better opportunity where I'm happier, more challenged and have stability.*
