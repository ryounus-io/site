description: This is the first project I built that I will use to kickoff the new 'Showcase' series with. I had several targets for this year and one of them was to build more user facing projects that I can use as part of my poftofolio. I will talk about what I built and how to use it yourself.

### What is the Showcase Series üéôüé®

The `Showcase` series is something new that I'm trying introduce to my blog, it will be my first attempt at starting a dedicated series of posts. The aim is to fulfill one of the targets that I set out for myself in 2021. I discussed in my [2020 review](/blog/2020-in-review-and-plans-for-2021/) how I build a lot of cool stuff that never get seen by most people. Often developers can see the code on my github repositories but not how it actually looks when put together in the end. I plan to change this by hosting those projects publicly and writing a short and sweet post about them. I can use services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host my projects for free, so theres nothing to hold me back.

### Visualise your life üé©‚ú®

`Life in Weeks` is a tool I built takes your date of birth and a arbitary value for your life expectancy. Using this it calculates your age in weeks and then visualise how much of your life you have lived so far, and how much you have left against the chosen life expectancy. It uses the canvas API to build a beautiful visualistion of 52 boxes for each week in a single year. These rows are repeated for the number of years you chose as your life expectancy. It will colour in all the boxes are in the past and will show you how many are left.

It can be a great way to visualise where you currently are in life and motivate you to achive greater heights. The idea was based off a video I saw on social media where someone had purchased a [poster](https://4kweeks.com/products/poster) with the exact same idea and they would colour in each week as it passed. It sounded awesome and would be a nifty tool for people to play around with, so I decided to build my own üõ†. The aim of this tool is to motivate and push people to make the most of their life, push them to new heights. The worlds your oyster as they say...

This project was a great chance for me to hack around with new technologies, so I used [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) to create it. I have seen a lot of praise for `Svelete` as a new and upcoming underdog in the frontend space, so this was a great chance for me to get first hand experience with it. I also got the chance to use `Rollup` as my bundler instead of `Webpack`, as well as using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) to do more complex stuff than I had ever done in the past.

`Svelte` is a new JS framework used to build powerful reactive web applications. It is well known for taking an alternative approach to handling reactivity, instead of making use of a virtual DOM like other web frameworks. Due to this difference it is often seen in benchmarks out-performing other frontend frameworks. In my expereince I was plesently surprised with the ease of use of this framework, it is very natural and easy to adapt to. I was up and going in no time. I had not really noticed any speed/performance benefits but this is probabaly because those changes are miniscule so not really noticed by us. `Svelte` has more of componenet style approach that was used by Vue instead of the new functional approach used by React. The documentation is great, I didn't really need to look at any other resources. I do feel like the community isn't as good but that would be a given for any new framework. It doesnt yet have the maturity and rich community that React and Vue enjoy. I'm sure it might one day in the future as more and more people try it out. When I first built this project I used the TypeScript starter template that they provide in the documentation, I quickly found it quite limiting and felt like it wasnt adding any benefit. It seemed more like a hiderance more than anything, so I decided to rip out the TypeScript and use vanilla JS. This comes from someone who loves using TypeScript for backend projects, it makes a lot of sense there. This may be an unpopular opinion but I believe TypeScript doesnt belong on the frontend.

The whole project is proudly hosted on Netlify and can be accessed [here](https://life-in-weeks.netlify.com), it is open-source so the repository is available on my Github [here](https://github.com/rahman95/life-in-weeks). Any contributions are welcome ü§ù
