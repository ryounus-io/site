**TL;DR** I have been surviving these unprecedented times and combating fatigue by keeping myself healthy both physically and mentally. üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüß†

### Preface

I've been taking a bit of a hiatus the past month or so, and have not been blogging as much as I wanted to. This break was due to the current COVID situation and also it being Ramadan last month, I was occupied with fasting and spending a lot of my time focusing on my sprirituality. 

A blog post is long awaited and I believe the topic I chouse is quite timely and suitable for the current circumstances we are in.
Unless you haven been living under a rock, you will know the tough and unprecedented times we are going through, I will try and outline what I've been doing to stay somewhat sane ü§™

### My Circumstance

Fortunately for me I have not been affected as badly as others, I'm still working during the lockdown, however from home. This change of working from home has not been very difficult for me as my work place had allowed us to WFH in the past when times were normal, we have always been allowed to work a few days from home without issue.

I think a lot of us in the tech industry are very fortunate as we can do most of our work from home. Being able to work from home is a great advantage but it does come with social limitations which we take for granted when in an office environment. I think a lot of developers are not very socially active in the first place so this lockdown is negatively affecting a lot of us in that way.

### What I've been doing

I personally have been trying my best to keep active and healthy during this time, however it's currently a lot more challenging due to the circumstances, but at the same time makes it so much more important. I have been doing a few things both in my personal and work life to try and remediate this;

#### Work

- Work Socials
    - Pub Quizes
    - Games e.g. MiniGolf
- Pair Programming

#### Home

- Physical Activity
    - Daily Walks
- Gaming
    - PS4
- Learning
    - Arduino Learning Starter Kit
    - GoLang
