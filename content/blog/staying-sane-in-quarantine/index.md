### Preface

Unless you haven been living under a rock, you will know the tough and unprecedented times we are currently going through. It is quite likely that you may know someone who has been directly or indirectly affected by the mass furloughing and redundancy spree that has been going on, these are very unfortunate times that are affect huge portion of the country. I think this short post is very timely of the current situation and I believe it is only right to do a piece on our current situation.

### My Circumstance

Fortunately for me I have not been affected as badly as others, I'm still working during the lockdown however from home. This change of working from home has not been very difficult for me as my work place had allowed us to WFH in the past when times were normal, we have always been allowed to work a few days from home without issue. I think a lot of us in the tech industry are very fortunate as we can do most of our work from home. Being able to work from home is a great advantage but it does come with social limitations which we take for granted when in an office environment. I think a lot of developers are not very socially active in the first place so this lockdown is negatively affecting a lot of us.

### What I've been doing

I personally have been trying my best to keep active and healthy during this time, however it's currently a lot more challenging due to the circumstances, but very important mentally and physically. I have been doing a few things both in my personal and work life to tackle this;
