**TL;DR** 2020 was a garbage year for a lot of us, lets hope 2021 is a step back to normality üôèü§û

### 2020 - The year it all went wrong

2020 was a very difficult year for everyone, I was fortunate enough along with my family to not have been affected by the adverse effects of the pandemic. I am aware that there are unfortunate individuals that lost their loved ones and their livelihoods due to the conditions brought about by the virus. My heartfelt condolences go out to everyone affected üò∞

As mentioned earlier I was fortunate to have managed to keep my job at [DAZN](https://engineering.dazn.com/), I don't recall there being any layoffs of being at that company. It was a good year for us in a business sense as we had our [global launch](https://www.dazn.com/en-GB/news/boxing/dazn-goes-global-streaming-service-launches-in-over-200-countries/qjveuh55ayyw1d0eal9yjtb03), a lot of work that me and my colleagues had been working on for a long time went live to customers in over 200 countries. In 2020 I volunterred to a secondment to work for a DAZN team in Amsterdam _remotely_, the team was working on the checkout services that would handle the influx of new customers that we would receive with the global launch. There were some organisational shifts in that team that led to this opportunity being presented to me, they had the need for some extra developers to help meet the deadlines for the launch. I spent the greatest part of 2020 working for this team, and had the ability to work on a lot of backend services using [Object-oriented](https://dev.to/charanrajgolla/beginners-guide---object-oriented-programming) [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The remainder of the year I spent with my original team and I'm glad to be back, there was a lot I missed out on during the secondment. I managed to get my bearings again and get back up to speed. Recently we have adopted [GoLang](https://golang.org/) in our tech-stack and I have really enjoyed the new challenges that were introduced.
