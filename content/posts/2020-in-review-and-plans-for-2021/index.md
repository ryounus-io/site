**TL;DR** 2020 was a garbage year for a lot of us, lets hope 2021 is a step back to normality 🙏🤞

### 2020 - The year it all went wrong

2020 was a very difficult year for everyone, I was fortunate enough along with my family to not have been affected by the adverse effects of the pandemic. I am aware that there are unfortunate individuals that lost their loved ones and their livelihoods due to the conditions brought about by the virus. My heartfelt condolences go out to everyone affected 😰

I was fortunate to have managed to keep my job at [DAZN](https://engineering.dazn.com/). It was a good year for us at the company as we had our [global launch](https://www.dazn.com/en-GB/news/boxing/dazn-goes-global-streaming-service-launches-in-over-200-countries/qjveuh55ayyw1d0eal9yjtb03), a lot of work that me and my colleagues had been working on for a while, had gone live to customers in over _200 countries_. I volunterred for a secondment to work with an Amsterdam based team who was working on the checkout services, that were an integral part required for the global launch. The greatest part of my year was spent working with them, I really enjoyed my time there and saw a lot of nuances in the way geographical dev centers differ across the business. The remainder of the year was spent back with my original team based in Leeds. Although I missed a lot of work, I have managed to get back up to speed with the changes that were made whilst I was gone.

For me personally the year was quite exhausting, I did not manage to make the most of the year like many other people. I had big plans for the year that never came to fruition. I wanted to make the most of the year by traveling across the globe, sight-seeing, thrill seeking and making memories for me to look back on. Unfortunately for us all, the year had different plans. When I think back to 2020, it just seems like huge blur. Nothing of significance that I could point back to in the year. The important thing is that the year was tough and that _we_ have made it through.

### 2021 - The bounce back 🤞

I'm sure we are all hoping for a better year in 2021. I hope with the introduction of the vaccine and the vaccination programmes now being rolled out, that things will return back to normality. One thing that 2020 has taught me is to not have big plans for the year, as they might not happen 🤣. However I still want to have some goals in place that I can look back at;

- Try blog monthly, even if its something very short. I want to aim for 12 new articles for this year 🙏
- Get my AWS certification -  I have been putting this off for a while but I think its something I need to do for my own career development. I want to aim for at least one certification this year 🎖
- Build more public facing tools/hacks - I build a load of stuff when experimenting with new technology but haven't got many pieces of work that people can visit on the web for themselves. This is something I want to change, I want host more of my silly stuff to show off what I get upto when learning new tech. 👷🏼
- Look after myself better. Due to lockdown and spending a lot of time at home, I have neglected my physical and mental health. I want to make sure that this is a priority for me this year ✨

I do realise that 2021 isnt just magically going to be better year, but I do think I am better prepared for it than I was a year ago. I believe I have developed the necessary tools to handle whatever life throws at me, so I can make it to the other side _(hopefully in one piece)_.
