**TL;DR** Lorem ipsum.. ..

The eager eyed amongst you may have had a look under the hood of my website and seen what tech its built up on. You dont need to look far to see the utility first css approach i have taken by utilising TailwindCss. Before I show my implementation of dark mode, I'm going to be walking through my approach to styling on my site.

### Why Tailwind

- Utility First
- Adam Wathan and my Laravel background
- Critisisms
- Effectiveness

### What is Dark mode

- Show Examples
- Pop culture
- Media query available

### My implementation

- Show Before and After
- Show tweet i used for inspiration for darkmode with tailwind
- Adding a `dark` breakpoint/screen
- Standardising my color palette
- Remove and Tidy up old css
